		<body>Hi Alex! Hope you're having a Good morning! I'm just calling to check on you because I've been told you
		haven't shown up to work for a week without giving notice. I understand these may be trying times for you, but
		for the future, I'd recommend clearing days off for personal reasons with your supervisors first. That being
		said, please get back to me as soon as you can with a possible date on which you can start back at work, so we
		can work out your pay for the month. Please note, that if you do not reply to this in the next 24 hours, we'd
		be forced to consider severance options for you.

		<body>You have chose to NOT listen to the messages. There were people who were counting on you to listen to
		those messages. What is wrong with you? Do you not like the ones closest to you who care enough to leave you
		a message? You have 7 unread messages. Would you like to listen to the NOW?

		<body>Hey Alex! Missed you at work again! It's no fun without you around. I was in the most
		BOOOORING meeting today. I'll tell you all about it tonight. You're still coming to Greg's party, right?
		RIGHT? You know I'll be all alone there tonight if you don't show up. It's going to be the absolute worst.
		Please come. Don't be mad. but I talked to your neighbour, and he thinks you haven't left your apartment
		the entire week. Please tell me you're not holed up in there like last time. I know you're not the happiest
		this time of the year, with what happened, but it's been a year Alex. It's time to move on. You can't beat
		yourself up over something you had no control over. So please leave the apartment and come out tonight.
		*pause and sigh*  Call me when you get this

		<body>Hi! I'm calling from Dr.Baxler's office, to confirm your bi-weekly appointment for 7 pm this afternoon.
		Wed like you to return to us with a confirmation as we have had you skip the past few appointments. Again,
		this is Dr.Baxler's office, and hope you have a good day.

		<body>Honey, Alex, it's Mom. I haven't heard from you in a while, and I know you don't do very well this time
		of the year with your Dad passing away. I'm not doing great either. I know it's been a tough year honey, but
		Dad wouldn't want you to be so down. Knowing Will, he would have wanted us to think of all the good times.
		Like when he made all those terrible bad jokes? *light chuckle*. Or when we went camping in California with
		all the mosquitos, that we had to sleep in our car. *quieter chuckle* He was the only one who could make you
		laugh. *light sob* It's been so long since I've seen you even smile. *break out into a full-blown sob* Don't
		do this to yourself. Call me back when you get this. *soft sniffle*

        <body>HELLO! HEEEELLLLOOO!! Is this thing on? CAN ANYONE HEAR ME? Oh wait, I suppose I'm so far out, it's gonna
        take a second for this to get back to Earth. Alright, first things first. I'm not entirely sure who's on the
        other end of this. *mutters under his breath* Looks like a civillian device. Anyway, you're the last person
        I can talk to seeing as to how the comms are down. And the commissary. And the other half of the ship that's
        broken off, which is now beelining for Mars. I've sent a distress beacon to SpaceY, so I'm probably gonna get
        picked up by the next carrier craft, so I got that covered. I wonder where everyone else on the ship is.
        Anywho, hopefully, there's someone on the other end of this line, so I haven't been talking to myself for the
        past minute. Hey what do you know? Maybe I WON'T die of loneliness before I die from hunger or thirst.
        Yeesh what a bummer, am I right?</body>

        <body>Damn, I didn't think it would work. I'm so glad you responded. My name's Dr Connor Morgan.
        You can call me Connor, if you'd like. Or you can just call me Doc. Because of the PhD, not because I'm a
        real doctor. Never went to med school. Too much blood everywhere. Speaking of out-of-context blood, did I
        mention I'm losing some? Meh, should be fine. Not like it's the worst thing that can happen. Hey, look on
        the bright side. The gravity module blew off with the rest of the ship during the explosion, so I've been
        floating around this whole time. The damn engineers at SpaceY really wanted us to have gravity so that
        "space travel feels natural". Well, who's floating now! Enough about me, tell me more about you.
        What's your name? What do you do? Tell me everything. It's not like I have anywhere to be.</body>

        <body>That’s great! I’m really glad I have someone to talk to. I know you told me your name, but I suffer from
        "Iwillforgetyournamia" so it would be super cool if I could just call you generic names, like “sport” or “champ”
        or “mass murderer incarcerated for slashing 200 people’s throats”. You know. The regular stuff.
        Just for narrative continuity, in case I forget your name down the line. The airlock is holding here, and
        I wouldn’t dare open anything in case I blow up into hundreds of tiny little pieces. So I’m stuck here in
        this room. Hey at least I’m in the containment unit, so if I start getting a little hungry, I can always pop
        one of the poop bags open, grab some pre-filtered urine and wine and dine in style. Well, that's my sit-rep so
        far. The rescue ship shouldn't be too far off now. How’s things back on Earth?</body>

        <body>Oh.. And I thought things were bad up here. Boy, am I glad I’m up here on a half destroyed spaceship.
        Well, speaking of worthless spaceships, I wonder who’ll be on the next carrier craft… Fingers crossed,
        it’ll probably be Rob. Or even Spencer. Oh damn, that’d be so cool! Those guys are the best. I was on
        a mission with Rob once, and he had a pack of cards. The illegal kind. *whispers excitedly* Don’t tell anyone,
        but they were made of PLASTIC. Ever since they outlawed plastic a few years ago, they’re so hard to find.
        I had never seen a pack until then. The cards were so smooth, it slid right off your finger. Of course,
        we had to keep it quiet in case the brig officer saw us, but we had so much fun playing that day. Aah..
        The good old days when I wasn’t stuck in containment with absolutely no one. I actually have no idea where the
        others are. Of course, protocol states, we should all send seperate distress beacons, and not go looking for the
        others, but I wonder if they're okay.</body>
